			<h1>Lab 3 - File Structure and File Transfer</h1>
			<p>This lab was to further create and edit local file structures then ensure they appeared correctly in the browser.

			</p>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>I had some difficulty editting the index.html files at first, but after some practice, I am more comfortable.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I had some problems organizing my labs. However, my partner was able to clarify the syntax I was unfamiliar with. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Overall, the assignment went well. My partner was very helpful throughout, and I was able to solidify some of my basic understandings of html. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>These are screenshots of my file structures and my source codes from  art101/index.html and art101/lab3/index.html as they appear in my browser.</p>
